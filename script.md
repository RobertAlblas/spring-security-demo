# Spring Boot Security demo script

## Intro
Spring Boot security adds a lot of security out of the box. The programmer does not have to think about these security
measures anymore and often does not realise that the vulnerabilities would still be there if Spring Boot Security
wouldn't have fixed them. Lets take a look at what Spring Boot Security does for you.
